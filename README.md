## Hello, my name is Charlotte! 🤗

A Front-End Developer and UX Designer passionate about creating user-friendly and visually appealing digital products.
With 12 years of customer service experience, I bring strong communication skills, collaboration and an eye for detail into the tech world.

Currently expanding my skills in TypeScript and Python, while also exploring how AI tools like ChatGPT can support development through faster learning, code review and better documentation.

Experienced as Scrum Master in an Industry Knowledge course project at Noroff, coordinating the design team and facilitating communication with the development teams to deliver functional solutions together.

In addition, I contribute as a UX Designer for [Juniors.dev](https://github.com/Juniors-Dev), a creative community and collaboration hub built to give junior developers real-world experience through teamwork, hands-on learning, and ship-worthy projects. My focus is on usability, universal design and creating consistent user experiences.
